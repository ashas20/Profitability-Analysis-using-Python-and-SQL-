# Profitability-Analysis-using-Python-and-SQL-
Goal: Identify drivers of profitability (sales channel, sales team, product) for a company using Python and SQL.
This project uses SQL and Python to perform an in-depth data analysis aimed at identifying the key drivers of profitability for a business. 
By analyzing sales data, I aim to uncover how different sales channels, sales teams, and product lines impact financial metrics such as revenue and profit margins. 
The insights gained from this analysis can be used to inform business strategy and describe scope for business growth. Future stages are visualization and leveraging the
Python Scikit-learn library to forecast future demand using regression models.
